## Troubleshooting

- **Extension Not Working**: Ensure that you have reloaded the extension after modifying any files.
- **No Elements Hidden**: Double-check your CSS selectors in `styles.css` or JavaScript in `content.js` to make sure they match the structure of the website.
- **No Images Displaying**: If all images are hidden by the template:
  - Check the `styles.css` file for any rules that might be hiding images. Look for selectors that affect images, such as:
    ```css
    img {
        display: none !important;
    }
    ```
  - If such rules exist, either modify or remove them to allow images to display.
  - You can also add an exception in your CSS to specifically show images:
    ```css
    img {
        display: block !important; /* or inline */
    }
    ```
  - After making changes, remember to reload the extension and refresh the webpage to see if images are now visible.
